# Keyboard Frenzy

This is a SPA made for Flatiron School's Rails/Javascript Portfolio Project called Keyboard Frenzy. Keyboard Frenzy is a typing game that uses a Rails API backend with a Javascript frontend. This app also has Rails sessions and cookies added back to the API so the user can log in/out and create an account before playing the game.

## Installation & Usage

Backend Setup:
1. CD into `js-typing-game-backend` folder and run `$ bundle install`.
2. Run Rails migrations with `$ rails db:migrate`.
3. Run `$ rails db:seed` to load seed data.
4. Run `$ rails server` to start up the default Rails server at `localhost:3000`.

Frontend Setup:
1. CD into `js-typing-game-frontend` folder.
2. Run `$ npx reload -b` to launch another server on `localhost:8080`.
